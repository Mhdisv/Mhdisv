<div id="Fashion" style="color: #dd5c5c;font-size: 27px;">What is Fashion?</div>
    <br>
    Fashion is a non-verbal way of communication that conveys a lot about the person’s personality, background and style.
    Earlier it was exclusively the world of the affluent, celebrities and royalty. However, fashion is now within
    the reach of the common man, especially the youth. Besides, dress fashion is an evolution of ideas, which begins
    as a fad, but in course of time gets accepted in society as a style, which could be in attire, behaviour or
    lifestyle. Fashion is mostly associated with glamour.It makes people feel confident and bold.<br><br>


    People can express themselves openly. Today fashion is not limited to western countries; now, every country has come out with their
    fashion sense, not only the clothing but the accent of that country, the living style.Vedantu experts have crafted
    an essay on fashion that covers its significance and how it reflects in your personality. This essay has promoted
    the thought perfectly that fashion is also about carrying yourself in society without having an attractive or
    trendy attire.  It is about being comfortable with yourself and not being a doppelganger of another person.
    “What is fashion?” It’s not that easy to give answer the question, because it expresses different things to
    different people. Generally, fashion refers to the change in style of garment. Fashion is a style that takes place
    on a body or face or an appearance that varies from person to person, day to day, time to time.
    It essentially involves change defined as a succession of short-term trends or fads.<br><br>

    The term “fashion” is used by practitioners and academics to generally refer to an industry which widely includes
    several sectors: textile, clothing, leather, knitwear, accessories, sunglasses, cosmetics, and jewelry. Generally,
    fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture.
    It comes from a Latin ward “Facere” which means “To Make”. We can simply explain fashion is an art.
    Fashion expresses of someone feelings. It also refers to the newest creations of textile designers.
    In this article I will teach about fashion classification and describes every segments.<br><br>

    Fashion is a natural instinct in people. Men and women are fond of adorning themselves to look more attractive
    and unique. If a particular style is accepted by a particular group of people (fairly large group),
    over a sufficient length of period (fairly large period), it is called ‘fashion’. Many fashions can also coexist.


<div id="Style" style="color: #dd5c5c;font-size: 27px;padding-top: 50px">What is Style?</div><br>
    Style is something that is unique to everyone. Style is the person’s own choice in clothes, accessories, and others.
    Style is not totally dependent on clothing; it can be related to anything that makes the person look stylish.
    In another view, style is the extension of fashion which does not change like fashion.<br><br>

    Style is your unique way of using the vintage to the latest fashion.

    Like Fashion, Style does not mean just clothing style. It also can be anything.
    Talking style, walking style, or writing style. In fashion, style is exactly the same as “personal style”,
    as I told you that style is a way to express your inner self. Style is an own particular look.
    It is about self-identity and personal choice of how you want to do something. For an easy example,
    Dungaree is a Fashion. But you always love to wear it with one unbuttoned shoulder or particularly
    with basic white tees. That is your style girl. So, style may be attached to the current Fashion or
    it can be untrendy. Style is strongly connected to the mind of an individual.<br><br>
    Style is always constant. It is not changeable like to fashion. It is the modification of fashion.
    Style is the basic outline of any garment.  It is a manner of doing something. It commonly refers to one’s fashion
    or outer appearance. Style word is very popular in fashion. Style is unique but when it is accepted by others
    then it is called fashion.<br><br>

<div id="D-Fashion & Style" style="color: #dd5c5c;font-size: 27px;padding-top: 50px">The real difference between fashion and style</div><br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;color: #79797a">Fashion is the relationship to the external.</span><br>
    It is concerned with “what’s out there” (fashion items, in the stores).
    It’s a matching process between what’s out there (fashion’s primary interest) to what I’m wearing.
    Is what I’m wearing a ‘match’ for what’s ‘out there’, to what’s been deemed ‘in fashion’?<br><br>

    <span style="font-size: 20px;color: #79797a">Style is the relationship to the internal.</span><br>
    It’s about “what’s in here” (my sense of self, my identity, my perception of who I am).
    The matching process is between what’s in here and how that is reflected and expressed in what I’m wearing.
    Does my clothing ‘match’ my sense of who I am, at least for today?<br><br>

    <span style="font-size: 20px;color: #79797a">Fashion distracts, style connects</span><br>
    If we go with that definition, it’s easy to see that there’s a huge difference in the orientation of our focus
    if it’s on fashion vs. style.  Fashion takes our attention away from ourselves, style brings our attention directly to ourselves.<br><br>

    <span style="font-size: 20px;color: #79797a">You, or the clothes?</span><br>
    This definition also recognises where the emphasis is placed.  With fashion, it’s on the clothing, the items deemed to be fashionable.  With style, it’s on the person.

    Fashion can be away to distance yourself from yourself, which may be a desirable thing for some people at some points in time.

    Style is a way to make closer your relationship to yourself, as its focus and orientation is on the self and how it’s informed and expressed by clothing choices.

<div id="Personal & Signature Style" style="color: #dd5c5c;font-size: 27px;padding-top: 50px">Personal & Signature Style</div><br>

    Personal style is of great interest to me.  Personal style is exactly that – personal to you.
    Unique to you.  Nobody but you needs to see the beauty and magic in your personal style.  That’s one of its hallmarks.
    And one of its beauties.

    Personal style is an inside job.  It’s something you create for yourself and it comes from within you.
    It is an expression of who you are, so the genesis of true personal style is an interior journey.

    Personal style isn’t purchased in a store – you can’t buy it.  Sure you can buy individual pieces that
    contribute to your personal style, but the style itself is not for sale.
<div id="Fashion style types" style="color: #dd5c5c;font-size: 27px;padding-top: 50px">Fashion style types</div><br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;color: #79797a">Classic</span><br>
    The classic fashion style is the epitome of timeless pieces and wardrobe essentials.
    It is one of the neat fashion style types that makes any lady look stunning with only classic clothing and
    accessories that everyone has in their wardrobe. No matter what the current fashion trends are,
    women can always feel confident and fashionable in those clothes.<br>

    Classic style is about the professional and polished look that never gets old.
    Colorwise, to make the most of this fashion style, stick to neutral hues and traditional colors like white,
    black, beige, khaki, gray, dark blue, and burgundy. As for the garments, some of the must-haves include blazers,
    pants, pencil skirts, plain t-shirts, and basic shirts.<br><br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;color: #79797a">Vintage</span><br>
    Do you like retro clothing? Then you are definitely into the vintage fashion style.
    It is all about embracing the fashion from a previous era and bringing back old trends.
    The great thing about this fashion style is, that there is no specific time period you need to stick to with your clothing.<br>

    If you like the fashion from a certain decade, you can go ahead and dress like it.
    Choose the appropriate accessories from that generation, too. There are many boutiques that sell
    vintage-inspired garments. But you can also find pretty great retro fashion in second-hand stores and thrift shops.<br><br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;color: #79797a">Victorian</span><br>
    Victorian style fashion is a very popular sub-fashion that takes inspiration from women’s Victorian-era clothing
    from the 1800s. Some of the must-have garments to make an outfit work are puffy-sleeve dresses, frilly petticoats,
    adorable collars or chokers, printed or striped socks, cuffs, and gloves. The color of the outfit depends on the
    vibe you are looking for.<br>

    The bright and colorful ‘Lolita style’ is extremely favored in Asian countries and among cosplayers and people
    from the comic and gaming communities. However, you can also see goth-style women in dark Victorian clothing quite
    often in North America and Europe. Both these sub-styles are similar but different at the same time.<br><br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;color: #79797a">French</span><br>
    French fashion style, also known as Parisian style, is all about timeless and minimalistic clothing choices that
    gently imply effortless elegance, grace, and simplicity. All that with comfort in mind. No wonder it is one of the
    most inspiring fashion style types in modern fashion.<br>

    Dressing like a Parisian lady gives a woman a sophisticating elevated look, achieved only with basic everyday
    clothes. Pay attention to the quality of the fabrics, and choose only easy to maintain, durable, and high-quality
    garments. Our advice is to follow trends, but don’t get too caught up in copying what’s viral in fashion.
    Express your own fashion style, show off your natural beauty, avoid looking overdone, and aim for effortlessness with your outfits.<br><br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;color: #79797a">Streetwear</span><br>
    When we talk about fashion and style, we cannot leave streetwear out.
    The 90s-inspired style is a modern urban fashion style that evolved from the streets, provoked by the skate
    and hip hop culture in California.<br>

    While it is a casual fashion style, streetwear is all about limited-edition designer garments, colorful prints,
    and expensive sneaks. Some of the best streetwear outfits consist of logo tees, tops with vivid prints, baggy pants,
    branded oversized hoodies, baseball caps, and of course – sneakers.<br><br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;color: #79797a">Business casual</span><br>
    Business casual fashion is formal wear with an everyday twist. It is office-friendly,
    perfect for company meetings and workplace functions. However, it is not strictly suitable for work,
    as you can wear it and look appropriately dressed for almost any social setting even after the workday is over.<br>

    Some of the wardrobe essentials to pull off the business casual look are oversized blazers,
    wide-leg pants, midi skirts, two-piece sets, as well as plain tees, cami tops, blouses, and shirts.
    For your winter outfits consider topping up with a fashionable coat.<br><br>

<div id="Find your style" style="color: #dd5c5c;font-size: 27px;padding-top: 50px">Find your style</div><br>
    While the latest trends can help you make fashion choices, when you dress to impress your individual style
    is what actually makes you glow and stand out as unique. But how do you stay true to your personal style if
    you have no idea what it is?<br><br>

    Here are a few ideas on how to find what works for you:<br><br>

    Build your wardrobe staples<br>
    Create outfits around your favorite clothes<br>
    Find style and clothing inspiration online, in magazines, on social media, etc<br>
    Have a collection of basics (capsule wardrobe)<br>
    Experiment with different styles<br>
    Explore new fashion brands<br>
    Make a wishlist<br>
    Note that even if you find your unique style now, it might change again over time. That’s why it is important to keep an open mind and stay curious about fashion and style.♡
